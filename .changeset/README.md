# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## How to add a changeset

When you make changes that should be released, run:

```bash
npm run changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select what kind of change this is (patch/minor/major)
2. Write a summary of the changes

The changeset will be added to this folder and should be committed with your changes.

## Releasing

When you're ready to release:

1. Run `npm run changeset:version` to bump versions based on changesets
2. Commit the version changes
3. Push to trigger the release workflow
